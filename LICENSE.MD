## Terms

### 1) Acceptance; authority; scope
By copying, modifying, distributing, deploying, hosting, or otherwise using the Work, You accept and agree to this License as a binding legal agreement.  
This License grants rights under copyright and closely related rights only; no rights are granted by implication, estoppel, or otherwise.

### 2) Definitions (tight and enforceable)
**“You”** means the individual or entity exercising permissions under this License.  
**“Control”** means direct or indirect control of an entity (e.g., ownership or power to direct management).

**“Personal Use”** means use by a natural person acting in an individual capacity, not on behalf of a Company, and not primarily for commercial advantage or monetary compensation.  
**“Personal Online Use”** means Personal Use where You run the Work on a device or server You control and access it over a network (including the public internet), solely for Your own use and (optionally) for members of Your household, with no access provided to the public or to a Company’s personnel for business purposes.

**“Company”** means any corporation, LLC, partnership, sole proprietorship, governmental entity, non-profit, educational institution, or other organization, and any entity under common Control with it.  
**“Commercial Use”** means use primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or monetary compensation, including selling, licensing, monetizing access, offering paid services, bundling into paid products, or using the Work to materially support revenue generation or cost reduction.

**“Production Use”** means use to provide, support, or operate a product, service, or business function for anyone other than the person performing Personal Use, including internal operational systems, customer-facing systems, or any environment relied upon for regular operation.  
**“Demo Use”** means using the Work (or a derivative) to demonstrate, evaluate, pitch, trial, benchmark, or proof-of-concept for a Company’s decision-making, sales process, marketing, customer onboarding, procurement, fundraising, or stakeholder review, whether internal or external.

**“Derivative Work”** includes any modification, adaptation, fork, or work based on the Work, as well as any work that incorporates any portion of the Work.  
**“Distribute”** means to provide a copy to any third party, including publishing to an app store, package registry, container registry, code host, or sending binaries/source to others.

### 3) License grant (what is allowed before Change Date)
Subject to continuous compliance with this License, Licensor grants You a worldwide, non-exclusive, revocable license to:
- Copy and run the Work for Personal Use and Personal Online Use.
- Modify the Work and create Derivative Works for Personal Use and Personal Online Use.
- Distribute the Work or Derivative Works **only** under this same License (including all definitions and restrictions), and only if the recipient’s permitted use would also be limited to Personal Use/Personal Online Use under this License.

For clarity, the general BSL grant is limited here by the restrictions in Section 4 and the distribution conditions in Section 5.

### 4) Explicit prohibitions (no companies; no demos; no production)
You must not, and must not permit any third party to:
- Use the Work or any Derivative Work for any Company purpose (including internal tools), even without charge.
- Use the Work or any Derivative Work for Production Use.
- Use the Work or any Derivative Work for Demo Use by or for any Company.
- Use the Work or any Derivative Work for Commercial Use.

**Bright-line rule:** If the user is a Company (or You are acting on behalf of a Company), then **no use** is permitted under this License unless Licensor grants a separate written commercial license.

### 5) Conditions for redistribution
If You Distribute the Work or any Derivative Work, You must:
- Include a complete copy of this License text with the distribution and keep all copyright notices intact.
- Prominently state that the Work is licensed for Personal Use and Personal Online Use only, and that Company/Production/Demo/Commercial use is prohibited.
- Mark any files You changed with a clear notice of modification and date.
- License the entire Derivative Work under this same License (no relicensing, no additional permissions, and no additional restrictions).

### 6) No trademark rights
This License does not grant rights in any trademark, service mark, logo, or project name of Licensor, except for truthful attribution and describing the origin of the Work.

### 7) Commercial licensing option
If Your intended use is not permitted, You must either (a) purchase or obtain a separate written license from Licensor, or (b) refrain from using the Work.

### 8) Termination; cure; downstream survival
Any violation of this License automatically terminates all rights granted to You under this License for the Work and all versions of it.  
After termination, You must immediately cease use, hosting, and distribution of the Work and any Derivative Works, and delete all copies under Your control (except copies retained solely for legal compliance).

If the breach is capable of cure, Licensor may reinstate rights in writing; no reinstatement is implied by silence or delay.

### 9) Warranty disclaimer; limitation of liability
TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE WORK IS PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON‑INFRINGEMENT, AND TITLE.  
TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, LICENSOR WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING FROM THIS LICENSE OR THE WORK.

### 10) Change Date; Change License (noncommercial, includes derivatives)
Effective on the Change Date, or the fourth anniversary of the first publicly available distribution of a specific version of the Work under this License, whichever comes first, the Work (that specific version) becomes available under the Change License below, and the rights granted under Sections 3–5 of this License for that version terminate.

#### Noncommercial Share‑Alike License (Software) v1.0 (NCSL‑SA)
Permission is granted to copy, modify, and distribute the Work and Derivative Works **only for noncommercial purposes**, and provided that:
- Any distribution (source or binary) must be under this same NCSL‑SA license (share-alike).
- Commercial Use is prohibited, including providing the Work as part of a paid product/service or to materially support a business.
- No trademark rights are granted.
- The Work is provided “AS IS” without warranties.

**Anti-circumvention of the switch:** You may not evade the noncommercial requirement by re-licensing, dual-licensing without Licensor permission, or distributing a Derivative Work under terms that allow Commercial Use.

### 11) Governing law; venue
This License is governed by Illinois law, excluding conflict-of-law rules, and any dispute must be brought in state or federal courts located in Cook County, Illinois, with both parties consenting to jurisdiction and venue there.

### 12) Severability; entire agreement
If any provision is held unenforceable, it will be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to be enforceable, and the remainder will stay in effect.  
This License is the entire agreement for the Work unless Licensor and You sign a separate written license.
