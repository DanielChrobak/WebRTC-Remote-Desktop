If You accept this License on behalf of any entity, You represent that You have authority to bind that entity; if You do not have such authority, You must not use the Work.

This License grants rights under copyright and closely related rights only; no patent rights are granted, and no rights are granted by implication, estoppel, or otherwise.

**Recommended implementation notice (non-binding):** For best enforceability, Licensor may require an “I Agree” click-through or equivalent affirmative assent before first use, and may record acceptance metadata (date/time, version, hash). This notice does not limit Licensor’s rights.

**“Control”** means direct or indirect control of an entity (e.g., ownership or power to direct management).

**“Company”** means any corporation, LLC, partnership, governmental entity, non-profit, educational institution, or other organization, and any entity under common Control with it.
